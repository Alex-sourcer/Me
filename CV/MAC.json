      "description": "My great passion is working with people, as I believe that each one of us is unique and we all have something to contribute. My vision of Recruitment is not so much to find a job for someone or simply fill a vacancy, but to improve the life of that person and the company. My other great passion, sport, has given me a mentality that makes me be looking for new challenges in which to improve myself.\nAccustomed to work individually and in a team, especially interested in the area of Digital Transformation, since will be essential in the future organizations. My work methodology is based in Inbound Recruiting; connecting not only on a rational level, but also on an emotional level, and putting the focus on the candidate's experience.",
